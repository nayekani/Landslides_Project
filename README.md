## Project summary

### The issue we are hoping to solve
The occurrence of landslides in hilly areas of the world have resulted in the loss of thousands of lives and injuries to millions more. They not only affect humans, but wildlife too.  [1](#acknowledgments)

### How our technology solution can help

Provides a likelihood estimate of an upcoming landslide in a region

### Our idea
Landslides are a threat to the local humans and wildlife, endangering the lives and households of a lot of people living in regions susceptible to them. It has also been observed that since landslides destroy a lot of public infrastructure, it is significantly difficult for assistance to reach the affected areas. Generally, they tend to occur in areas with a rapid population and economic growth  [2](#acknowledgments). We have obtained good quality data related to landslides over the past decade. Following that, we used AI services to identify the most important causative factors for a landslide and trained a classification model using XGB Classifier Algorithm. The result of this model is the likelihood of a landslide occurring in the region in the near future. We have also implemented a user-friendly and minimalistic GUI that prompts the user for these causative factors and also outputs the result. We have taken into consideration that all the factors may not be available with the user due to a lack of available recorded data and hence we only expect some of the most important ones and assume reasonable defaults for the rest. We were not able to find an existing comprehensive solution taking into account all the possible causative factors and zeroing-in on them. Our model guarantees high precision metrics as tested on the test data.

## Technology implementation

### Required IBM services and tool

- **IBM Watson Machine Learning:**- Build and train machine learning models with tools for all skill levels. Deploy and manage models at scale.

- **Watson Studio**
Build custom models and infuse your business with AI and machine learning

- **watsonx.ai**  - Used AutoAI to identify key parameters and train the model and the Jupyter notebook feature to write and test code.
AutoAI divided the dataset into a training and testing split. For this project 90% of the dataset was used for training the model and 10% for testing it.

### Project development roadmap

The project currently does the following things.

- Accept user inputs for the causative features identified for provided geographical region.
- Classification algorithm
- Display landslide likelihood in the region through the UI.

In the future we plan to...

See below for our proposed schedule on next steps after Call for Code 2023 submission.

### Future data collection using sensors
**Real time simulation of obtaining geological-information through sensors of area to be monitored for landslides ( Phase-2 deployment plan )**

To predict the landslides for a particular region its significant to monitor the factors like temperature,humidity,weather,soil etc of
that particular region.
We can achieve this by planting various sensors in that region. Below we discuss how we can integrate DHT11 sensor with Arduino to measure the humidity and temperature of the region

**Components and supplies:**
1. DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor
2. Arduino UNO
3. Breadboard
4. Jumper wires

**Apps and platforms:**
1. Arduino IDE

**Build the circuit**

## Dataset Used:-
Dataset we used for this application are
downloaded from the link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajeshtikait/supervised-landslide-dataset/data

### Model Comparisons Details
In our application we require to use classification technique as per our dataset. So after doing analysis while Configuring AutoAI experiment we selected two algorithms to train & test pipelines out of many algorithms.
1. **XGB Classifier**
Accurate sure procedure that can be used for classification problems. XGBoost models are used in a variety of areas including Web search ranking and ecology.

2. **Random Forest Classifier**
Constructs multiple decision trees to produce the label that is a mode of each decision tree.

After comparing different pipelines based on their accuray we deployed & used model in our application is XGB Classifier which generates 0.98 accuracy.
